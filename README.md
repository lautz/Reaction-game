Reaction Lab | Reflex EngineReaction Lab is a high-precision browser-based application designed to test and train neural latency (reaction time). It combines 3D visuals, procedural audio, and a sophisticated scoring algorithm to provide a gamified cognitive assessment.🎮 How to PlayInitialize Session: Set your desired Start and Target intensity levels on the setup screen.The Goal: Click the screen  the instant the 3D sphere turns GREEN.Rules:Wait for the signal. Clicking too early results in a "False Start".Ignore Decoys: Do not click on PURPLE or ORANGE signals.Focus: You have exactly 20 rounds to prove your efficiency.Progression: The difficulty scales linearly from your Start Intensity to your Target Intensity over the course of the 20 rounds.⚙️ Difficulty System (Intensity)The "Intensity" level (1-10) dynamically alters the physics and probability of the simulation:Target Size (Fitts's Law): At higher intensities, the target becomes significantly smaller, requiring more precise motor control.Decoy Probability:Levels 1-3: No decoys. Pure reaction.Levels 4-6: Moderate chance of Purple decoys.Levels 7-10: High chance of Purple and Orange (Level 2) decoys.🧠 The Scoring AlgorithmReaction Lab uses a "handicapped" scoring model to reward playing at higher difficulties. It acknowledges that hitting smaller targets amidst distractions takes physically longer than hitting large, static targets.1. Intensity HandicapThe engine calculates an Adjusted Reaction Time by subtracting a bonus from your raw average speed.Formula: Handicap = (Average Session Intensity - 1) × 8msExample: If you play at Intensity 10, you receive a 72ms deduction from your raw time, allowing you to score higher even if your raw reaction is slower due to the difficulty.2. Performance Audit (Ranks)Your Final Score (0-10) is calculated based on your Adjusted Reaction Time, minus any penalties for False Starts.ScoreThreshold (Adjusted)Rank TitleVerdict10< 220msHUMAN AIMBOTBreak the simulation.
